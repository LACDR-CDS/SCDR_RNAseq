        "# Session 3 & 4\n",
        "In the last session, you learned the basic processing steps for RNA sequencing data. Now you will do the next steps in the analysis of transcriptomics data to investigate the transcriptional impact of a GATA4 mutation on human cardiomyocyte differentiation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Background\n",
        "Mutations in **GATA4**, a key transcription factor in heart development, are linked to **congenital heart defects** and **cardiomyopathy**.  \n",
        "To investigate the molecular basis, you will compare **isogenic wildtype** and **GATA4-G296S mutant** cells at different stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation using RNA-seq.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Explore whether GATA4 mutation alters global gene expression patterns (PCA).  \n",
        "2. Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between mutant and WT at each stage.  \n",
        "3. Visualize DEGs with volcano plots and heatmaps.  \n",
        "4. Perform GO enrichment to determine affected biological pathways.  \n",
        "5. Interpret whether the mutation leads to loss of cardiomyocyte identity and/or gain of non-cardiac programs.  "
